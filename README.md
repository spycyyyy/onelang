## One lang intro
By condensing everything on a single array, attempt to create a program that includes both function and memory on a single stack
User can interact by typing commands into the block.
Overall, this program provides a simple and interactive way to evaluate mathematical expressions using a custom language. 
It demonstrates the use of recursive descent parsing and exception handling in C++.

Here are some feature demonstrated

## Custom Mathematical Expression Language

The program supports a custom mathematical expression language that includes the following features:
* Registers: The program uses a set of registers (r) to store values. The registers are indexed from 0 to 15.
* Memory: The program uses a stack memory (mem) to store values. The memory is indexed from 0 to 255.
* Operators: The program supports the following operators:
* Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, ^
* Comparison operators: >, <
* Logical operators: &, |
* Factorial operator: !
* Memory operator: [] , #
Syntax: The program uses a syntax similar to C++ for mathematical expressions. For example, 2+3*4 is a valid expression.
