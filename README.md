## W H A T
* [V] Condensing everything on a single array (includes both condition block and memory block)
* [V] Interact by typing commands into the block. (APL language)
* [X] Fast creation of list, string and loop
* [X] express everything in the form a dictionary
* [X] figure out how to kick start the program 

## Custom Mathematical Expression Language
The program supports a custom mathematical expression language that includes the following features:
* Registers: The program uses a set of registers (r) to store values. The registers are indexed from 0 to 15.
* Memory: The program uses a stack memory (mem) to store values. The memory is indexed from 0 to 255.
* Operators: The program supports the following operators:
* Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, ^
* Comparison operators: >, <
* Logical operators: &, |
* Factorial operator: !
* Memory operator: [] , # (this two works by directly accessing everything on the list)
