| Feature       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Registers** | The program uses a set of registers (`r`) to store values. Registers are indexed from 0 to 15. |
| **Memory**    | The program uses a stack memory (`mem`) to store values. Memory is indexed from 0 to 255. |
| Arithmetic    | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`                                                     |
| Comparison    | `>`, `<`                                                                    |
| Logical       | `&`, `|`                                                                    |
| Factorial     | `!`                                                                         |
| Memory        | `[]`, `#` (directly accessing everything on the list) |
| Pointer       | `~` (moving around the stack without changing anything) |
